# DNA-methylation of the Painted Lady butterfly

Boman J, Zhu Y, Höök L, Vila R, Talavera G, Backström N (2023) Environmental stress during larval development induces DNA methylation shifts in the migratory painted lady butterfly (*Vanessa cardui*). Mol Ecol 32:3513–3523. https://doi.org/10.1111/MEC.16957


Bisulfite-sequencing data - order of analysis

1. Run Nextflow methylseq pipeline
2. Transform stranded CpG reports into bed format
3. Ready for all different kinds of analysis, such as finding differentially methylated regions using BSmooth

RNA-sequencing data - order of analysis

1. Run Nextflow rnaseq pipeline
2. Do differential expression analysis and integrate with methylation data
